A chatroom which is written in JAVA.

We have two version of the server. The EfficientServer is very fast but it also needs more CPU resources. The TcpServer.java is more better for some cheap servers.

The TcpServer still has some problems, I wrote it just for practicing my coding algorithm skills.

My plan is to add an database and create a javaweb for the client.
